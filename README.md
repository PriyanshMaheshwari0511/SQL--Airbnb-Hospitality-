# Hospitality Intelligence Hub: Analyzing Airbnb Data for Informed Decision-Making üè•

## Project Overview
**Hospitality Intelligence Hub** is a data analysis and business intelligence project designed for Airbnb. This SQL-based project focuses on analyzing accommodation data from New York City and other locations worldwide to uncover trends, insights, and patterns that drive strategic decision-making. By leveraging SQL queries and database optimization techniques, this project provides Airbnb with robust data-driven insights to enhance operational efficiency, market analysis, and customer satisfaction. 
Airbnb is a leading online marketplace that provides accommodation options across various neighborhoods in New York City and around the globe. To ensure their business operations run smoothly, Airbnb has developed a cutting-edge 'Hospitality Intelligence Hub' that analyzes data from various sources for better insights and trends. By using this tool, Airbnb gains valuable insights into their business operations, which help them make informed, data-driven decisions.

The 'Hospitality Intelligence Hub' uses MySQL to analyze data which contains information on various neighborhoods in New York City, including the types of listings available, the prices of these listings, and their availability. The system tracks trends in customer behavior and preferences, such as frequently booked room types, price trends for specific neighborhoods etc. With this tool, Airbnb can identify areas for improvement and make changes to their operations to improve customer satisfaction. For example, the 'Hospitality Intelligence Hub' helps Airbnb optimize pricing for different neighborhoods to increase occupancy rates, improve listings based on customer preferences, and enhance the customer experience by identifying areas for improvement. In our case study on Airbnb's Hospitality Intelligence Hub, we have two tables: 'Listings' and ‚ÄòBooking_Details. The ‚ÄòListings' table contains information on the various neighborhoods in New York City, including the types of listings available in each neighborhood. The 'Reviews' table, on the other hand, has information on the prices of these listings, reviews and their availability.

## Database Structure

- **Tables**:
  - `listings`: Contains details about Airbnb properties, including location, price, availability, and host information.
  - `bookings`: Tracks customer bookings, stay duration, and associated costs.
  -  'price': The nightly price of the listing.
  - `reviews`: Stores customer reviews, ratings, and feedback.
  - `neighborhoods`: Information on different neighborhoods and their attributes.

- **Relationships**:
  - Listings are linked to neighborhoods by `neighborhood_id`.
  - Bookings reference `listing_id` and are linked to customers.
  - Reviews reference `booking_id` and provide customer feedback.

---

## Key Queries and Analysis

1. **Top-Performing Neighborhoods**:
   ```sql
   SELECT n.name, COUNT(b.id) AS total_bookings
   FROM bookings b
   JOIN listings l ON b.listing_id = l.id
   JOIN neighborhoods n ON l.neighborhood_id = n.id
   GROUP BY n.name
   ORDER BY total_bookings DESC;
   ```

2. **Price Trends by Month**:
   ```sql
   SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM b.check_in_date) AS month, AVG(l.price) AS avg_price
   FROM bookings b
   JOIN listings l ON b.listing_id = l.id
   GROUP BY month
   ORDER BY month;
   ```

3. **Average Rating per Host**:
   ```sql
   SELECT l.host_id, AVG(r.rating) AS avg_rating
   FROM reviews r
   JOIN bookings b ON r.booking_id = b.id
   JOIN listings l ON b.listing_id = l.id
   GROUP BY l.host_id
   ORDER BY avg_rating DESC;
   ```

4. **Occupancy Rate Analysis**:
   ```sql
   SELECT l.id, l.name, 
          COUNT(b.id)::DECIMAL / COUNT(DISTINCT b.check_in_date) AS occupancy_rate
   FROM listings l
   LEFT JOIN bookings b ON l.id = b.listing_id
   GROUP BY l.id, l.name;
   ```
